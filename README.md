# bloated-hello-world
The most bloated "Hello, World!" Ever.

## Specifications

- It **must** print "Hello, World!" (with or without commas and exclamation marks) in either GUI window or in terminal.
- It **must** take an unneccesary amount of processing time/amount just to print "Hello, World!". That's basically the definition of "bloat". i think.
- You *may* include performance metrics in your version, but make sure to specify your CPU model, and RAM size at minimum.
- It **must not** include any attempts to increase processing time by unneccesary means. *Your "Hello, World!" program don't need prime number calculator.*
- It *may* include credits and such.
- It *may* include other features considered unneccesary for a program that prints "Hello, World!". however, priting "Hello, World!" **must** be a main feature.
